## Overview

Download [csf\_assign05.zip](csf_assign05.zip) and unzip it.

In this assignment, you will develop a chat client program that communicates
synchronously with a server in real-time. You may think of this as an
implementation inspired by classical chat systems such as IRC.

**Note:** We highly recommend that you use C++ for this assignment.
The provided skeleton code includes partially implemented classes which
we encourage you to use as the basis for your client and server implementations.

## Goals of the assignment

The main goal of the assignment is to provide an opportunity to create a
network application.

Although this will be a relatively simple program, it is representative of a
larger class of network-enabled systems:

* It will have a protocol for communication between clients and server
* it will allow communication over a network (specifically by accepting TCP
    connections from clients)
* It will use concurrency and synchronization primitives to coordinate access to
    shared data on a remote server

## Demo

Here is an example chat session with two different senders and three receivers, all
connected to the same server:

<!-- Widget loads here -->
<div id="demo-widget"></div>

(thanks [asciinema](https://asciinema.org/) for the wonderful terminal recording
widget!)

<!-- Load the Asciinema Widget -->
<script src="{{site.baseurl}}/js/asciinema-player.min.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{{site.baseurl}}/css/asciinema-player.css">
<script>
  AsciinemaPlayer.create('assign05/demo.cast', document.getElementById('demo-widget'), {
  speed: 2,
  idleTimeLimit: 2,
  poster: 'npt:0:32'
  });
</script>

## The Protocol

The client and server communicate by exchanging a series of _messages_ over a
TCP connection. There are two kinds of clients: a _receiver_ which is used to
only read messages from the server, and a _sender_ that is used to send messages
to the server. To allow multiple groups of people to talk independently, the
server partitions clients into "rooms". All receivers in the same room
will receive that same set of message, and all senders in the same room will
broadcast to the same receivers.

A _message_ is an ASCII-encoded transmission with the following format:

```
tag:payload
```

A _message_ is subject to the following restrictions:

* A message must be a single line of text with no newline characters contained within
    it.
* A message ends at a newline terminator which can be either `"\n"` or `"\r\n"`.
    Your programs must be able to accept both of these as newline delimiters.
* The `tag` must be one of the operations specified in the "tag
    table".
* The payload is an arbitrary sequence of characters. If a tag has a structured
    payload, the payload must be formatted exactly as specified.
* If a tag has a payload that is ignored (e.g., the "quit" and "leave" tags),
  the tag/payload separator character `:` must still be present (e.g. `quit:` not `quit`),
  even if the payload is empty
* An encoded message must not be more than `MAX_LEN` bytes.

The first message sent to the server by a client is considered a login message,
and must have one of the following tags:

* `slogin`
* `rlogin`

These commands allow the client to log in to the server with the specified
usernames. `slogin` is for a sender, and `rlogin` is for a receiver. A receiver
terminates its connection by simply closing its socket. The server will
automatically detect when this happens by looking a send failure on the next
message sent to the client.

If a client logs in with `slogin`, from that point forwards, it is a synchronous
protocol. The client sends a message, and the server sends a response,
indicating the status of the request.

The following message types are defined:

Tag | Sent by | Payload content/format | Description 
----|--------|------------------------|-------------
err | server | message\_text | client's request was not carried out.
ok | server | message\_text | client's request ran to completion.
delivery | server | room:sender:message\_text | a delivery of a received message to a receiver.
slogin | sender | username | log in as sender.
rlogin | receiver | username | log in as receiver.
join | sender/receiver | room\_name | client wants to join specified room (which will be created as necessary). Client leaves the current room if applicable.
leave | sender | [ignored] | the sender sends this command to leave the chat room they are currently in
sendall | sender | message\_text | send a message to all users in room
quit | sender | [ignored] | client is done, server will close the connection.

You may have the following assumptions about the usernames and room
names we test your programs on:

* They will be at least one character in length
* They will contain only letters (`a`-`z` or `A`-`Z`) or digits (`0`-`9`)

The reference server implementation will reject operations in which the username
and/or room name do not meet these criteria.

## Assignment skeleton

We have included a reasonably comprehensive assignment skeleton in the starter
code to help you factor your design into manageable parts. You are free to change
any part of the design, up to and including writing your assignment from
scratch, so long as your program follows all semantics of the reference
executables.

If you elect to change the skeleton code or the Makefile, ensure that you build
executables with the sames names. Exercise extreme caution if you change our
synchronization architecture to avoid introducing issues.

Here is a description of the files included in the starter code:

* `client_util.{h,cpp}` - contain utility functions that are shared between the
    send client and receive client.
* `connection.{h,cpp}` - class describing a connection between a client and
    server. Used by both the receiver, the sender, and the server.
* `csapp.{h,c}` - functions from the CS:APP3e book. You are free to modify
    functions here as needed, e.g. adding const qualifiers for const
    correctness, but be careful if you don't completely understand the function
    you're changing!
* `guard.h` - RAII style block-scoped lock. Creating the object acquires the
    lock, destroying the object (i.e. when it goes out of scope) releases the
    lock.
* `message.h` - class representing the protocol message format.
* `receiver.cpp` - contains the main function for the receiver.
* `room.{cpp,h}` - room class used by the server.
* `sender.cpp` - contains the main function used by the sender.
* `server.{cpp,h}` - server class that tracks and aggregates the entire chat
    server's state. Highly recommended that you follow the sketch presented here.
* `server_main.cpp` - Contains the main function for the server. If you
    implement `server.cpp` correctly above, you should not need to make changes
    to this file.

## Milestone 1: The clients

For the first part of this assignment, you will be responsible for implementing
the _receiver_ and the _sender_ to communicate with a server binary included in
the starter code. Note that the following messages are considered unused and do
not need to be handled by any client:

* `senduser`

### Receiver

The receiver will be run in the following manner from the terminal:

```
./receiver [server_address] [port] [username] [room]
```

The receiver must send the `rlogin` message as its first message to the server.
The following sequence diagram has been provided for your reference (note that
this only covers the "happy case"):

![Receiver communication flow diagram](assign05/a5_receiver_flow.png)

The receiver should print received messages to `stdout` in the following format:

```
[username of sender]: [message text]
```

The following messages must be handled:

* `rlogin`
* `join`
* `delivery`
* `ok`
* `err`

If the server returns `err` for either the `rlogin` or `join` message, the
receiver must print the error payload to `stderr`/`cerr` and exit with a
non-zero exit code. The receiver does not need to exit cleanly, we expect it to
terminate it by sending it a `SIGINT` (a.k.a. `<ctrl>+c`).

### Sender

Run the sender using the following command:

```
./sender [server_address] [port] [username]
```

The sender must send the `slogin` message as its first message to the server.
The following communication flow has been provided for your reference (note that
this only covers the "happy case"):

![Sender communication flow diagram](assign05/a5_sender_flow_edit.png)

The following messages must be handled:

* `slogin`
* `join`
* `sendall`
* `leave`
* `ok`
* `err`

After the sender logs into the server, it should read `stdin` for messages and
commands. Commands start with the `/` character and may be one of the following:

* `/join [room name]` - joins the specified room on the server using a `join`
    message
* `/leave` - leaves the current room, stopping all message delivery using a
    `leave` message.
* `/quit` - Instructs the server to disconnect the current send client using a
    `quit` message.
* All other commands should be rejected with an error message printed to
    `stderr`/`cerr`

You may assume that all command arguments are valid if the command matches a
recognized command.

The client must listen for a response from the server after sending each message
(synchronous protocol). It is okay to stop reading user input during this time. If the
server returns `err` in response to the `slogin` request, the sender should print the
error payload to `stderr`/`cerr` and exit with a non-zero exit code. If the server returns
`err` for any other request, the sender should print the error payload to `stderr`/`cerr`
and continue processing user input.

If the `quit` commend is issued, the sender must wait for a reply from the
server before exiting with exit code 0.

### Error Handling

The following diagram summarizes how errors should be handled:

![Error communication flow diagram](assign05/a5_error_flow.png)

Each error message must be exactly one line of text printed to `stderr`/`cerr`. The error
text printed must be exactly the payload returned from the server in the `err` message.
You may assume that this payload will always be correctly formatted. For client-side
errors, you may choose any error string.

You must handle failures to open the TCP communication socket by printing an
informative error message and exiting with a non-zero exit code. You may assume
that the server will stay online for the entire duration of the chat session.

If a client is run with an invalid number of arguments, a descriptive usage
message should be printed to `stderr` indicating how the program should be invoked.

### Implementation Tips

You are free to use any functions in the provided `csapp.h` header. In particular, we
recommend that you use the `rio_*` family of functions for writing to the TCP socket file
descriptors instead of using the raw syscalls. TCP connections have significant latency
that requires reads and writes to be buffered correctly for expected behaviour. Remember
that `rio_readlineb` does not strip the newline characters.

To open the client connection to the server, we recommend using the
`int open_clientfd(char* hostname, char* port)` function. This function accepts
a hostname (server address) as a string and the desired port as a string, and
returns a file descriptor that is ready for use with the `rio_*` family of
functions.

### Testing

To aid your testing your program, we have provided a sample server implementation as a
Linux binary in the starter code (see the [Reference implementation](#reference-implementation)
section below.) We have intentionally compiled it without
debugging information and stripped it of symbols. If your clients are
implemented correctly, you should be able to type in a message and see the
message appear on all read clients in the same chat-room. You may run our
server binary using the following command:

```
./reference/ref-server [port number]
```

where `[port number]` is any integer greater than 1024. If the server fails to
open on the given port, try another one. You must specify the same port between
all clients and the server.

Note that you might need to set execute permission on the executable before
running it:

```
chmod a+x reference/ref-server
```

We have only tested the binary on the Ugrad systems, and do not guarantee that it
will work anywhere else. It definitely will not work on Mac computers, but may
work on certain versions of WSL2.

You can also test one client at a time by using netcat as follows:

```
nc localhost [portnumber]
```

You can also spawn a netcat "server" using the following commands:

```
nc -l <port>
```

where port is a number greater or equal to 1024. You would then type in the server
responses yourself in the netcat terminal window after you get a client connected
to the "server" following the sequence diagrams above.

You can then pretend to be a receiver by sending a `rlogin` request:

```
rlogin:alice
join:cafe
sendall:Message for everyone!
```

Or you can pretend to be a sender by sending a `slogin` request:

```
slogin:bob
join:cafe
<messages will appear here as they are sent to the room "cafe">
```

Do not Valgrind `netcat` as that will not be testing your program, and may
generate false positives. You should ensure that you run Valgrind directly on the
client executables (e.g. `valgrind ./receiver ...`).

We have recorded a screencast which demonstrates several testing scenarios
using combinations of the reference server, your clients, your server,
and netcat:

> <https://jh.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=3d9460a0-eca0-487b-8609-ae7f01050601>

We also have a recording of a terminal session where we demonstrate some of these
manual testing workflows:

<div id="client-test-widget"></div>
<script>
  AsciinemaPlayer.create('assign05/client_test.cast', document.getElementById('client-test-widget'), {
  speed: 2.5,
  idleTimeLimit: 2,
  poster: 'npt:0:32'
  });
</script>

#### Automated testing

You can obtain the automated test scripts here:

* [test_receiver.sh](assign05/test_receiver.sh)
* [test_sender.sh](assign05/test_sender.sh)

Download them on in the terminal using `wget [link]` while you
are in the same directory your project is in. Don't forget to make them
executable after downloading them using `chmod u+x [file]`.

`test_receiver.sh` is invoked as follows:

```
./test_receiver.sh [port] [sender_client] [room] [server_in_file] [output_stem]
```

and `test_sender.sh` is invoked as follows:

```
./test_sender.sh [port] [sender_client] [client_in_file] [server_in_file] [output_stem]
```

Note that `test_sender.sh` exits with the exit code the client exited with, so you
can verify that your client exited with the correct exit code by running `echo
$?` **immediately** after running the test script.

The arguments are:
* `port` - port to run server on. Pick anything above 1024.
* `*_client` - name of the client binary to run. 
* `room` - room to connect the sender to.
* `server_in_file` - file containing list of messages server should send, one
    message per line
* `client_in_file` - file containing list of user inputs to the client, one per line.
* `output_stem` - base filename for the output, the files
   `[output_stem]-received.out`, `[output_stem]-client.out`,
   `[output_stem]-client.err` will be created which correspond to the messages
   sent by the client to the server, the output the client printed to `stdout`, and the
   output the client printed to `stderr` respectively.

While we highly encourage you to come up with your own test inputs, we have
provided the following test inputs for reference:

* [test_receiver_server.in](assign05/test_receiver_server.in)
* [test_sender_server.in](assign05/test_sender_server.in)
* [test_sender_client.in](assign05/test_sender_client.in)

You can run the example receiver test using:

```
./test_receiver.sh 12345 receiver partytime test_receiver_server.in receiver_test
```

and you should verify that `receiver_test-client.err` is empty, that
`receiver_test-client.out` contains exactly:

```
bob: hi alice
robert_de_bobert: I have the cookies.
bob: cookies?

```

and that `receiver_test-received` contains exactly:

```
rlogin:alice
join:partytime

```

You can run the example sender test using:

```
./test_sender.sh 12346 sender test_sender_client.in test_sender_server.in sender_test
```

and you should verify that `sender_test-client.err` is empty, and that
`sender_test-received` contains exactly:

```
slogin:alice
join:partytime
sendall:Hello World!
join:cafe
sendall:get me 1 coffee
quit:bye

```

With the exception of the payload to `quit` (it can be any text).

## Milestone 2: The server

For this part of the assignment, you will be responsible for implementing the
_server_. The server is responsible for accepting messages from _senders_ and
broadcasting them to all _receivers_ in the same room.

The server can be run using the following command:

```
./server [port]
```

where `[port]` specifies the port that the server should listen on.

### Tasks

Here is a suggested order of implementation:

* Create a thread for each client connection. You will need a datastructure to
  represent the data associated with each client. We recommend that you use the same
  `Connection` class you used in part 1 to represent these connections. You
  may use the login message to determine what kind of client is trying to
  connect.
* Process _control messages_ from clients.
* Broadcast messages to all receivers in a room when a sender sends a message. At this
  point your server should work with well-behaving clients that don't send messages
  at the same time.
* Add synchronization for access to share data structures (`Room`s, `Server`) so
  no messages are lost, even if a receiver leaves or tries to join in the middle of a
  broadcast. You also must not lose messages that are sent at the same time
  from two different senders.

### Using threads for client connections

Your server applications will to handle connections from multiple clients simultaneously
in order to be useful (after all, it is quite sad to only be able to chat with oneself).
Threads are a useful mechanism for handling multiple client connections because they allow
the code that communicates with each client to run concurrently.

In your main server loop (`Server::handle_client_requests()` if you are following our
scaffolding), you should create a thread for each accepted client connection using
`pthread_create()`. A struct should be created to pass the `Connection` object and other
required data to the client thread using the `aux` parameter of `pthread_create()`, and
`worker()` should be used as the entrypoint for the thread. It may also be a good idea to
create a `User` object in each client thread to track the pending messages, and register it
to a `Room` when the client sends a join request.

You can test that your server handles more than one connection correctly by
spawning multiple receivers and senders on the same server, and checking that
the messages sent from all senders get correctly delivered to all receivers.

### Receiver and sender loops

We recommend that you separate the communication loops for the senders and receivers into
the `chat_with_sender()` and `chat_with_receiver()` functions respectively. Please refer
to the sequence diagrams in Part 1 to determine how the loops should be implemented.

We have already handled the `SIGPIPE` signal for you in our provided server main
function, so you should be able to detect partial reads by matching the return
value of `rio_*` against the size of the message transmitted. If they do not
match, you may assume that a transmission error has occurred and should handle it as an
[error](#error-handling).

For all synchronous messages, you must ensure that the server always transmits
some kind of response (`err` for error, `ok` for success) to receive full
credit. Failure to transmit a response to a synchronous message will cause the client to hang.

In the receiver loop, you must terminate the loop and tear down the client thread if any
message transmission fails, or if a valid `quit` message is received. For the sender loop,
you must terminate the loop and tear down the client thread if any message fails to send,
as there is no other way to detect a client disconnect. Be sure that you clean up any
datastructures and entries specific to the client before terminating the thread to prevent
resource leaks.

### Broadcasting messages to receivers

We recommend that you implement the pub/sub pattern for synchronization, using the
`MessageQueue` class we outlined for you. In this pattern, a sending thread iterates
through all the `User`s in a room and pushes a message into each `MessageQueue`. This
event wakes up the receiver thread, allowing it to dequeue the messages at its leisure.
Here is a diagram of how this could work:

![Room broadcast](assign05/a5_room_broadcast.png)

Queues are a useful paradigm because they allow messages to be processed at a different
rate than we they are transmitted . If we had to wait for all messages to finish sending
before releasing the lock on the room, we could end up spending all of our time servicing
send requests, which would deadlock the server.

To implement this "notification" behaviour, we recommend that you use a
combination of a semaphore and a lock. The lock ensures that the message queue
can only be modified by one thread at a time, and the semaphore is used to
"notify" the other end that a new message is available. Recall that a semaphore
blocks a thread when it goes below zero, and can be incremented (`sem_post`) and
decremented (`sem_wait`, `sem_timedwait`) from different threads. Thus, we can
essentially use the semaphore in each `MessageQueue` as a sort of "smart"
counter of the available messages in the queue. This implements the correct
behaviour: if there are no messages available, we want the receiver to sleep until
there are available messages, and each time a message is sent, it reduces the
available messages by one.

The sender client thread may return a response to the sender as soon as the
message is done being added to all MessageQueues. It does not need to wait until
the message has actually been delivered to all of the receivers in the room, but
it should not return a status until the message is done being enqueued.

**Important:** Remember that stack allocated data is _thread local_ and must not be shared
between threads. Since the `MessageQueue` is being used as an inter-thread communication
primitive, you must ensure that messages pushed to the queue are always heap-allocated
(e.g. allocated using `new`). Likewise, ensure that the dequeuing thread takes
responsibility for freeing the memory. Finally, don't forget to empty the queue (i.e. free
all queued messages) when the queue is destroyed to prevent memory leaks when a _receiver_
disconnects before all messages could be delivered to it (consider where this happens
carefully to implement the correct synchronization).

Note: While we recommend `sem_timedwait()` in the starter code, `sem_wait()` is also
acceptable for simplicity (i.e. you may safely ignore `ts`). (Using `sem_timedwait()` has
the advantage that the thread handling a connection with a receiver will not be blocked
indefinitely if there are no messages waiting to be delivered to that receiver.)

### Synchronizing shared data

Synchronization is typically necessary when multiple threads can attempt to access the
same data in a hazardous manner at the same time. Synchronization may also be necessary if
certain semantics are desired of accessed to shared data (e.g. guaranteed ordering).

Strictly speaking, if the data type is _atomic_, read accesses need not be synchronized so
long as they can never occur at the same time as a write. However, for this assignment, we
are not using _atomic types_, so you will need to synchronize _all concurrent access_.

The section of code where synchronized access to data is imposed is called a
"critical section", and should be limited in length as concurrency is greatly
restricted in these sections. Making critical sections too long can potentially
cripple performance in real-world applications.

Add synchronization to the `Server`, `MessageQueue`, and `Room` objects to
ensure that updates to these objects will never be lost, not matter how the
objects are accessed. For example, if multiple clients try connect to the server
at the same time, both clients must be registered correctly, without losing
either one. Likewise, if two clients try join a room or send a chat at the
same time, both requests must be successfully carried out, with neither
operation "lost" or partially completed.

In a more practical sense, you may want to introduce a mutex to the `Server`,
`Room` and `MessageQueue` objects, and then add critical section(s) where needed
to ensure that the synchronization requirements are met. **Very important**: You
should not allow critical sections to be accessed across object boundaries to
prevent synchronization bugs. For example, if you implement a mutex in the
`Room` class, you should make it private and only synchronize to it from `Room`
methods.

Consider your synchronization hazards carefully! There are a few cases that may
cause data races that are not immediately obvious (e.g. you must ensure that
clients never broadcast and join/leave the room at the same time to prevent
races).

#### Guard locks

To help ensure that locks are always released, we have provided a "block scoped lock"
implementing the "Resource Acquisition Is Initialization" (RAII) pattern in `guard.h`.
This means that constructing the `Guard` object blocks until the lock is acquired, and
allowing it to go out of scope releases the lock. If you need the lock to be held for a
shorter scope than the entire enclosing block, you can introduce additional scoped blocks:

```
void foo(pthread_mutex_t *lock) {
    ...
    // introduce new block scope
    {
        // Aquire lock, blocks thread until lock becomes available
        Guard(*lock);
        // do something with the lock held
        // invariant upheld: only one thread may enter this section at a time.
        ...
    }
    // lock is RELEASED here, and threads will be concurrent
    ...
}
```

We **highly recommend** that you use `Guard` objects instead of raw calls to
`pthread_mutex_lock()` and `pthread_mutex_unlock()`, as the block scoping
ensures that you will never forget to release the lock. This prevents a vast class
of possible deadlocks. Remember that `pthread_mutex_init` must be called exactly
once on each mutex before it can be used.

#### Synchronization report

Since synchronization is an important part of this assignment, we'd like you to
support a report on your synchronization in your README.txt. Please include where
your critical sections are, how you determined them, and why you chose the
synchronization primitives for each section. You should also explain how your
critical sections ensure that the synchronization requirements are met without
introducing synchronization hazards (e.g. race conditions and deadlocks).

### Error Handling

If the server fails to bind the listen TCP socket for any reason on the host, you must
print an error message to `stderr` and return a non-zero return code. Once the server
binds the port and starts listening for clients, it does not need to handle shutting
itself down.

We expect your server to be _robust_. This means no matter what any client
sends, in any order, your server should not crash. To ensure that this is
the case, you probably will want to use the `rio_*` functions, and the
`Connection` class you implemented for the clients. Some (non-exhaustive)
examples of bad things the clients may do that _should not_ crash your server
include:

* Sending messages longer than `Message::MAX_LEN`
* Sending invalid messages that cannot be parsed, including empty messages.
* Sending messages with invalid tags.
* Leaving and joining at any point in the communication sequence.
* Attempting to send a response to a client that has dropped off between the
    time a message was sent and before it could accept its response.

If a message cannot be parsed, could not be carried out, or is not a valid
message, you must send an `err` message to the client with a descriptive
payload. If a sender tries to send a message or leave a room while it is not in
a room, you must also return `err` with a suitable payload. This _should not_
stop the server, nor disconnect the client. Otherwise, you _must_ send an `ok`
message with suitable payload. Failure to send a response to a client operating
in synchronous mode at any time is a _severe_ bug that will cause most tests to fail.

All client data should be cleaned up as soon as the server detects that the
client connection has died. You may assume that any transmission error indicates
that a client has died. It is okay if receivers are not cleaned up until the
next broadcast is sent to a room for ease of implementation.

Since your server has no way of shutting down, you may ignore the "in-use at
exit" portion of valgrind. You should still fix any leaks (sections marked
"definitely lost"), invalid reads, invalid writes, and invalid conditional jumps

### Implementation tips

Start early! There are quite a few things you will need to consider in order to
receive full credit. We recommend that you start by implementing the logic that waits for
new client connections and spawns client threads to handle them. If you are struggling
with synchronization, we recommend that you start with a basic implementation without any
synchronization, which might help you identify critical sections.

We recommend that you use _detached threads_. This means that you will not have to join
them back to the primary thread, and that you do not have to save the `pthread_t`returned
from `pthread_create()`. There are two safe ways to do this. This first is to initialize a
`pthread_attr_t` struct with the correct flags using `pthread_attr_setdetachedstate()`,
and pass this into the relevant argument for `pthread_create()`. The second is to call
`pthread_detach(pthread_self())` from the child thread. Under no circumstances should you
attempt to detach the thread using a call in the creating thread, after the child
is created, as that will cause a data race.

Don't forget to initialize your synchronization primitives before use. For
`pthread_mutex_t`s this is `pthread_mutex_init()`. For semaphores, this is `sem_init()`.
Use of synchronization primitives before they are initialized is undefined behaviour and
_will break your code_. You should also destroy your synchronization primitives when you
release their associated resources. Failure to call the destruction functions may result
in leaked memory.

Do not attempt to share stack-allocated data between threads. This is undefined
behaviour and generally causes _severe_ bugs. Instead, ensure that any data
that must be accessed between threads is part of a heap-allocation.

We also recommend using scope to your advantage. RAII resources such as the provided
`Guard` type prevent mistakes like forgetting to release resources, and defining variables
to the narrowest scopes they require dramatically reduces the clast radius of any
bugs that do arise. Aim to fail fast and early if invalid states are encountered.

If the server appears to become unresponsive for a long period of time it has
probably deadlocked, and you will need to examine your synchronization. If a
server doesn't bind a socket on a given port, try another one, as the port you are
trying to bind may be already taken (e.g. by another student on your ugrad machine).

### Testing

We have provided the testing methods below to help you ensure that your program
is working correctly. _We highly recommend against using the autograder as your
primary testing solution_. The autograder is designed to be robust and thorough,
and intentionally does not provide test feedback to you. Instead, we recommend
that you use local testing techniques so you can use tools like debuggers and
print statements to help debug.

#### Manual Testing

To test this program, you may follow the instructions in the [MS1
Testing](#testing) section, replacing the invocations of your client with
`reference/ref-[client]`. Netcat testing will probably also be a good idea so
you can figure out exactly what your server is sending.

For example, to test a server implementation against netcat, you could open
three terminal windows. In the first, you would run `./server [port]`, in the
second you would run `nc localhost [port]` and send a `rlogin` message, in the
third you would run `nc localhost [port]` and send a `slogin` message. Then you
would follow the flow diagrams to send messages from your netcat "clients",
verifying the server responses that appear. If everything works in manual netcat
testing, you would move onto testing with our reference binaries using a similar
approach, before trying the automated test scripts posted below.

Here is a capture of an example testing session:

<div id="server-test-widget"></div>
<script>
  AsciinemaPlayer.create('assign05/server_test.cast', document.getElementById('server-test-widget'), {
  speed: 2.5,
  idleTimeLimit: 2,
  poster: 'npt:0:32'
  });
</script>

### Automated Testing

Here are some automated tests you can try:

* [test_sequential.sh](assign05/test_sequential.sh)
* [test_interleaved.sh](assign05/test_interleaved.sh)
* [test_concurrent.sh](assign05/test_concurrent.sh)

Don't forget to make these scripts executable using `chmod u+x [script name]`!

`test_sequential.sh` runs two senders, one after the other, and is invoked
using:

```
./test_sequential.sh [port] [first_sender_input_file] [second_sender_input_file]
[output_stem]
```

`test_interleaved.sh` runs two senders, alternating between them for each line
of the input file. I can be invoked as follows:

```
./test_interleaved.sh [port] [unified input file] [output_stem]
```

`test_concurrent.sh` does its best to break your server's synchronization by
spawning all sorts of clients that try send data as fast as possible while
simultaneously switching rooms and disconnecting. It can be invoked as follows:

```
./test_concurrent.sh [port] [iterations] [settling time]
```

`[output_stem]` will set the file that contains the receiver output after each
run. `[output_stem].out` contains the output of the receiver, and
`[output_stem].err` contains the receiver errors. For the sequential and
concurrent tests, we always expect the first user to be `bob` and the second
user to be `alice`, and errors for their respective senders will be found in
`[user].err`. Please keep this in mind as you write additional tests.

While we highly recommend you write your own test cases, we have provided the
following tests inputs as examples:

* [test_inter.in](assign05/test_inter.in)
* [seq_send_1.in](assign05/seq_send_1.in)
* [seq_send_2.in](assign05/seq_send_2.in)

You can run the reference sequential test using the following command:

```
./test_sequential.sh [port] seq_send_1.in seq_send_2.in seq_recv
```

and you should get nothing in `seq_recv.err`, `bob.err`, `alice.err`, and the
following output in `seq_recv.out`:

```
alice: Hello everyone
alice: I am trying to purchase the cookies
alice: Please give me your headcount and the number of cookies you want
bob: Hi Alice
bob: This is Bob.
bob: I want a chocolate peanut cookie with walnuts.
bob: Thanks!

```

and you should ensure that your server does not print anything to `stdout`.

You can run the reference interleaved test using the following command:

```
./test_interleaved.sh [port] test_inter.in inter_recv
```
and you should get nothing in `inter_recv.err`, `bob.err`, `alice.err`, and the
following output in `inter_recv.out`:

```
alice: This is a message from alice
bob: And this is a message from bob
alice: each alternating line of messages...
bob: will be send by a different client...
alice: this test ensures that clients are served in order
bob: and that one client may not monopolize the entire transmission

```

and you should ensure that the server does not print anything to stdout.

Some good parameters to start the concurrency test with are 10000 iterations and
30 seconds of settling time. If the test succeeds, you should see `Tests passed
successfully!`. Increasing the number of iterations will increase the likelihood
of detecting a race condition. If the test ends with `Failed to verify*` try
increasing the settling time. If increasing the settling time to over one
minute does not allow the test to pass, you probably have a race. However, do
note that having this test pass does not guarantee that your code is sync-safe.

You should run the concurrency test _last_, after you get all other
functionality working. The concurrency test will exercise all parts of your
server while it tries to cause race conditions.

Note that the server can be run under valgrind by setting the `VALGRIND_ENABLE`
environment variable to `1`. For example, if you want to run the sequential test
with valgrind, the command would be run using `VALGRIND_ENABLE=1
./test_sequential.sh ...`. Remember that you may ignore the reports for "indirectly lost",
"possibly lost", and "in use at exit", and any leaks caused by `pthread_*`
functions, but must fix everything else.

## Reference

In the `reference` directory of the project skeleton, you will find executables
called `ref-server`, `ref-sender`, and `ref-receiver`. As the names suggest, these
are the reference implementations of the server, sender, and receiver. Your
`server`, `sender`, and `receiver` executables should be functionally
equivalent.

Here is a suggested test scenario.  You will need three terminal sessions.

In terminal number 1, run the server (user input in **bold**):

<div class="highlighter-rouge">
<pre>
$ <b>./ref-server 47374</b>
</pre>
</div>

You can use any port number 1024 or above instead of 47374.

In terminal number 2, run the receiver (user input in **bold**):

<div class="highlighter-rouge">
<pre>
$ <b>./ref-receiver localhost 47374 alice cafe</b>
</pre>
</div>

Make sure you use the same port that you used in the `server` command.

In terminal number 3, run the sender (user input in **bold**):

<div class="highlighter-rouge">
<pre>
$ <b>./ref-sender localhost 47374 bob</b>
<b>/join cafe</b>
<b>hey everybody!</b>
<b>/quit</b>
</pre>
</div>

In terminal number 2 (where the receiver is running, you should see the following output):

```
bob: hey everybody!
```

Note that while the `ref-sender` program will terminate when the `/quit` command
is executed, the `ref-server` and `ref-receiver` programs will need to be
terminated using Control-C.
