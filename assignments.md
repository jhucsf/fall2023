# Assignments

This page lists the programming assignments for the course.

Some advice about the programming assignments:

* Do not wait until the last minute to start: if we give you two weeks
  to complete an assignment, it's because we expect that it will take you
  two weeks (working steadily)
* Ask questions on [Courselore](https://courselore.org) and in office hours
* Use good programming practices
* Test your code thoroughly (plan to spend about as much time testing the code as writing it)

*Individual* assignments must be completed individually.

For *Pair* assignments, you may work with one partner, or do the assignment individually.
Please note that if you chose to work with a partner:

1. You and your partner **must** work together to a reasonable degree
2. You are both responsible for ensuring that the work is completed

If you feel that your partner is not making an adequate contribution on an
assignment, you may finish and turn in the assignment assignment individually.
You may *not* use your partner's lack of contribution as an excuse for not
completing the assignment.

Please read the [style guidelines](resources/style.html) so that you know what our coding style expectations are.

**Important**: All assignments must compile and run on x86-64 Linux.
Please see the [Resources](resources.html) page for information on setting
up an x86-64 Linux development environment. (There are a number of good options.)
